## About this implementation
The code is based on the **Detonation** drop by the
[DegenToonz](https://degentoonz.io) Team (of which I was the lead developer for
that project).

The original code is not Open Source, this repository is based on the original
implementation, but has been rewritten and doesn't include any sensitive part
from the original project.
While I created the technical implementation of this, the DegenToonz Team came
up with the whole idea of it, including the tokenomics and storytelling behind
it.
